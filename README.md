# Predicting_Furture_Video_Game_Sales

### Selected Topic
See if there is a relation shipbetween a video games user/critic ratings and how many copies it ends up selling.

### Reason
Selected this topic because as a video gamer there are many factors that goes into what makes a video game sell. It can be because of who made the game, all of the teasers released to increases hype, the genre of the game, what platforms it is available on , etc. Pridicting how well a game is going to sell and if it any good to begin with is very diffucult but with this analysis I hope to see if there is a relationship with a games review ratings and how many copies of that game will sell.

### Data Source
The data is from a .csv file abtained from https://github.com/MohammadAlnafi/Video-Game-Sales which contains various games, their platform, release year, genre, publisher and the amount of copies sold(in millions) throughout the world and another .csv located on kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/top-video-games-19952021-metacritic with games, their releases, platform, user review ratings and metacritic review ratings. 

### Question to answer
Is there a relationship between video game user/critic ratings and how many copies of the games are sold?

## Machine Learning Model
I will be using a linear regression model in order to see if there is a relationship and I will be trying PCA, joining and using scikit-learns StandardScaler module to clean my data inorder to make it usable for the analysis.
