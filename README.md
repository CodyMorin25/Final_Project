# Predicting_Furture_Video_Game_Sales

### Selected Topic
Predict future sales for puplishers/developers based on the performance of previous released games.

### Reason
Selected this topic because as a video game lover there are many factors that goes into what makes a video game sell. It can be because of who made the game, all of the teasers released to increases hype, the genre of the game, what platforms it is available on , etc. Pridicting how well a game is going to sell is very diffucult because of these many factors but I want to try even if it isn't perfect but it is a start.

### Data Source
The data is from a .csv file abtained from https://github.com/MohammadAlnafi/Video-Game-Sales which contains various games, their platform, release year, genre, publisher and the amount of copies sold(in millions) throughout the world. 

### Question to answer
Is it possible to predict a publishers/developers future video game sales based on previously released games?
