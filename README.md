# Video_Games-ReviewsVSCopies_Sold

### Selected Topic
See if there is a relationship between how a paid critic rates a game and how a user who bought the game rates the game

### Reason
Selected this topic because as a video gamer there are many factors that determines if a video game will be good or bad. It can be because of who made the game, how long the development was, all of the teasers released to increases hype, the genre of the game, what platforms it is available on , etc. Pridicting whether a game is  any good to begin with is very diffucult but with this analysis I hope to see if there is a relationship with a critics review vs a users review.

### Data Source
The data is from a .csv file abtained from kaggle at [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/top-video-games-19952021-metacritic](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/destring/metacritic-reviewed-games-since-2000) with games, their releases, platform, user review ratings and metacritic review ratings. 

### Question to answer
Is there a relationship between video game user/critic ratings?

## Machine Learning Model
I will be using a linear regression model in order to see if there is a relationship and I will be trying PCA, joining and using scikit-learns StandardScaler module to clean my data inorder to make it usable for the analysis.
